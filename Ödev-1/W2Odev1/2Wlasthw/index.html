        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Jane Austen (1775–1817) was an English novelist known for her six major novels that critique the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Her works explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favorable social standing and economic security.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her novels include *Sense and Sensibility*, *Pride and Prejudice*, *Mansfield Park*, and *Emma*. Austen’s realism, biting irony, and social commentary have earned her a place as one of the most widely read and beloved writers in English literature.
